## Feedback


### Judge


#### System Configuration

* The team I observed seemed to spend the majority of their time (at least 2 hrs) just configuring the systems.
* They struggled with just getting networking and DNS functional.
* The team I observed struggled with networking in general and could have greatly benefited from an SOP just to get things operational.
* I see a distinction between basic configuration for operations vs hardening to avoid attack.


#### Injects

* This was my favorite part of the exercise as I feel it has the most real world applicability.
* P3 instructed that a vulnerability scan be performed using NMAP.
* I wasn’t clear on whether this was a trick question due to the fact nmap isn’t that effective for vulnerability info.
* The Clemson team just performed the nmap scans but got little to no meaningful data from it.


#### Injects

* P4 was a resource intensive inject that the Clemson team never had time to address.
* It was odd that tool guidance was given for P3 but not for P4.


#### Time

* 3 hours didn’t seem to be sufficient for a quality experience especially given the configuration challenges.
* If substantial configuration challenges exist, then two hours of setup and hardening seemed to be warranted prior to Red team activity.
* A more limited time of Red team activity would allow the teams to both harden properly and go through a[n IR] follow-up process.


#### Service Monitoring

* There was a lot of confusion for the Clemson team around service monitoring.
* They were hesitant to disable potentially compromised accounts due to the potential it would impact the service.
* This led to a continual compromise of the servers.
* **Providing the teams with a list of required accounts for service monitoring that are not touched by Red Team seems to be a more fair approach.**
