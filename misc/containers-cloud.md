## Containers


### What is a Container?

* Abstraction at the application layer
* Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the kernel
* Isolated processes in user space


### How is it different from a VM?

* VMs abstract physical hardware
* Containers take up far less space
* Containers can start nearly instantly

### What types of containers are there?

* Docker
* LXC
* FreeBSD Jails



## Docker

* Open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
* Primarily developed for Linux
* High-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation


### Docker Architecture

### Docker Objects

* Images
* Containers


#### Docker Images

* Read-only template with instructions for creating a container
* Images are often *based* on another image w/ some changes
* For example, image based on Ubuntu installs Apache w/ configs
* Dockerfiles 


#### Docker Containers

* Runnable instance of an image
* Create, start, stop, move, or delete containers using the API


### Docker Commands

* man docker-run
* docker ps -a
* docker images
* docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
* docker rm --force $(docker ps -aq)
* docker rmi --force $(docker images -aq)
* docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash


### Docker Registries

* Docker registries store Docker images
* docker pull OR docker run
* docker push
* Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/
* Docker Cloud - https://cloud.docker.com/


### Docker Compose

![docker-compose](docker-compose.png)

* Used to run multi-container Docker applications
* Uses YAML files for configuration
* Bring entire projects up/down simultaneously


### Docker Swarm

* Multiple docker hosts run in **swarm mode** act as managers and workers
* If a worker node becomes unavailable, tasks are distributed elsewhere
* Modify service configuration without the need to manually restart
* Submit service definitions to manager nodes who distribute units of work
* Units of work called tasks given to worker nodes


### Short Demo

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/nbulischeck/dctf.git
cd dctf
sudo python ctf.py -bus
```
