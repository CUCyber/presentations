## What is Social Engineering?

> Social engineering, in the context of information security, refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.


## Imagine a Scenario



# Exploring the Human Mind


## Basic Human Qualities

1. The desire to be helpful and to trust people
2. The fear of getting into trouble or feeling guilty
3. The willingness to cut corners


## Personality Traits

1. Diffusion of Responsibility
	- Employees of a large company feel their actions don't directly impact the company
2. Thinking they will benefit or will impress someone else
3. Not wanting to throw away a relationship with another person



# Schemes


## Dumpster Diving

* Sifting through garbage to find valuable information left intact or that can be recovered
* The fourth amendment does not apply to garbage left on public property
	- See: _California v. Greenwood_


## Shoulder Surfing

* Looking over one's shoulder to steal confidential information/credentials
* Prevention
	- Cover your PIN pad entries with your hand
	- Make sure no one is pointing a camera your way
	- Make sure nobody is staring at your hands while typing passwords
	- Reduce screen viewing angles


## Tailgating

* Following someone who is credentialed through a secure checkpoint
* _Hold the door!_


## Phishing

* Masquerading as a legimate person or service to obtain sensitive information
* Tricking users to:
	- Login to an insecure or fake form
	- Send sensitive or valuable information directly to the attackers
	- Downloading or executing malicious files
* Most popular medium for attack is email

## Pretexting

* Inventing a identity and scenario with the intention of manipulating a specific target
* Often involves creating a relationship with the victim
* Requires planning, research, and practice to be successful



# The Cycle


## The Cycle - Illustrated

1. Information Gathering
2. Developing Relationships
3. Exploitation
4. Execution


## 1. Information Gathering

* Gathering information about the targets to determine how to best build a relationship.
* Info you may gather
	- Personal and professional contacts
	- Birth dates and other personal information
	- Likes, dislikes, and interests


## 2. Developing Relationships

* Insert yourself into their life
* Put yourself into a position of trust (expand on different positions like authority and submission)


## 3. Exploitation

* Exploiting the target by leveraging the relationship you created and any information you gathered about the target and situation


## 4. Execution

* Once the action has been completed or has failed the cycle is complete
* Pivot using newly gathered information and repeat the cycle if necessary



# Counter-Measures


## Combating Social Engineering

* Implement controls
* Regular reviews of controls
* Simulated attacks



# Tooling


## Phishing vs Spear Phishing 

Phishing is a wide net cast across an entire organization
Spear Phishing is targeted against a single user


## SE Frameworks

* GoPhish
* SET


## GoPhish

Open-Source Phishing Framework

https://getgophish.com/


## GoPhish usage

Run an spear phishing campaign against targets inside a corparation
Simple to set up, can be setup with a template, landing page, and a listening URL

## Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)

"Specifically designed to perform advanced attacks against the human element"

# Physical Security


## Why look at Physical Security?

Can provide access that social engineering can't


## Locks

Picking the lock can give access to an area that social engineering failed to


## Door Badge access control

System Clemson uses to control access to buildings and rooms.

Badges can be tricked into giving a response to a fake reader.
This can be played back to the real reader to gain access.
Standard readers need to be withing 3 inches, 

## Elavators

Large Corparations often use elevators as access controls to entire floors.
* bypass badge control to unlock floors
* use independent service key
* use fire key
