## The History of Hacking


### The Definition of "Hacker"

1. an adherent of the technology and programming subculture
2. someone who is able to subvert computer security



## Older than Old-School Hacking


### Wireless Telegraph

* Invented by Guglielmo Marconi
* Telegraph that could broadcast radio-telegraphic messages
* Broadcasts on a specific wavelength to establish private communications channels.


#### Wireless Telegraph Hack

* John Nevil Maskelyne
* Man-on-the-Side Attack
* Raced Marconi's anticipated message to mock him

Note:
This happened in June 1903 during a public demonstration by Marconi.


### Nazi Census

* Nazis invaded France in 1940 and demanded a census
* Census forms were compiled onto tabulator cards
* Column 11 indicated the citizen's religion


#### Nazi Census Hack

* René Carmille
* Requested to be in charge of the tabulator cards
* Instructed to print a list of all Jewish people living in France
* Mishandled punch cards, hacked his own machines

Note:
Carmille reprogrammed his machines to never punch information from Column 11 onto any census card. He was eventually found out 4 years later and sent to Dachau. As a result of his actions, Carmille saved an untold number of lives.
