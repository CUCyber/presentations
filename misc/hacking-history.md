## The History of Hacking


### The Definition of "Hacker"

1. an adherent of the technology and programming subculture
2. someone who is able to subvert computer security



## Older than Old-School Hacking


### Wireless Telegraph

* Invented by Guglielmo Marconi
* Telegraph that could broadcast radio-telegraphic messages
* Broadcasts on a specific wavelength to establish private communications channels.


#### Wireless Telegraph Hack

* John Nevil Maskelyne
* Man-on-the-Side Attack
* Raced Marconi's anticipated message to mock him

Note:
This happened in June 1903 during a public demonstration by Marconi.


### Nazi Census

* Nazis invaded France in 1940 and demanded a census
* Census forms were compiled onto tabulator cards
* Column 11 indicated the citizen's religion


#### Nazi Census Hack

* René Carmille
* Requested to be in charge of the tabulator cards
* Instructed to print a list of all Jewish people living in France
* Mishandled punch cards, hacked his own machines

Note:
Carmille reprogrammed his machines to never punch information from Column 11 onto any census card. He was eventually found out 4 years later and sent to Dachau. As a result of his actions, Carmille saved an untold number of lives. 



## Old-School Hacking


### MIT Tech Model Railroad Club

* First reference to "hacking"
* Mid-1950s meeting notes
* Eventually lead to the discussion of telephone hackers years later


### Phone Phreaking

* Exploring/exploiting the telephone system
* Started late 1950s 
* Golden age of late 1960s, early 1970s
* Exploring the telephone network wasn't (and isn't) illegal, in and of itself

Note:
But phone phreaks sometimes used their skills to make free telephone calls, and that was illegal


#### Wargames Phreaking

Note:

#### John Draper

* ![Captain Crunch](captain-crunch.jpg)

Note:
This whistle emitted the same frequency that AT&T long lines used to indicate that a trunk line was available for routing a new call.


### Morris Worm (1988)

* Robert T. Morris
* 23-Year-Old Grad Student from Cornell
* Exploited known vulnerabilities in Unix sendmail, finger, and rsh/rexec, as well as weak passwords
* Not written to cause damage, but to highlight security flaws


#### Morris Worm Damage

* The same computer could be infected multiple times leading to a fork bomb effect
* Took down 10% of the Internet's computers at the time
* U.S. Government Accountability Office put the cost of the damage at $100,000–10,000,000


### ILOVEYOU (2000)

* "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs"
* Sent a copy of itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook
* Philippines -> China -> Europe -> US


#### ILOVEYOU Damage

* $5.5–8.7 billion in damages worldwide
* Estimated to cost $15 billion to remove the worm
* 50 Million Infections
* The Pentagon, CIA, the British Parliament and most large corporations decided to completely shut down their mail system



## Modern Day Hacking


### Cyber Warfare


#### Russo-Georgian War

* August 5th 2008
* Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline was subject to a terrorist attack near Refahiye in Turkey
* Sophisticated computer attack on line's control and safety systems that led to increased pressure and explosion


#### Stuxnet

* Malicious worm first discovered in 2010
* Targeted SCADA systems
* Designed for PLCs in Iran's nuclear program
* Exploited four zero-days in Windows


### Hacktivism

* the use of technology to promote a political agenda or a social change
* free speech, human rights, or freedom of information movements


#### Anonymous

* Appeared on 4chan during 2003
* Rise in 2008 after a DoS attack on the Church of Scientology
* Took down 10k Dark web sites related to CP

Note:
The dark web takedown was accomplished by compromising a private web hosting service named Freedom Hosting II.


#### WikiLeaks

* WikiLeaks was founded in 2006 by Julian Assange
* "multi-national media organization and associated library"
* Primarily associated with whistleblowing
* Julian Assange currently resides in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London


#### LulzSec

* Formed in May 2011
* Five members of Anonymous
* "Sabu," "Kayla," "T-Flow," "Topiary," "AVUnit," and "Pwnsauce"
* Hacked HBGary, Fox Television, Tribune Company, PBS, Sony, Nintendo, and Senate.gov


##### Lulzsec Downfall

* Hector Monsegur (Sabu) logged into IRC without a proxy
* FBI immediately had him, he folded fast
* Eventually all of the other members were ratted out
* "He’d do anything for his kids. He didn’t want to go away to prison and leave them. That’s how we got him."


### Bug Bounty Programs

a deal offered by many websites and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities


#### First Bug Bounty

* Hunter & Ready
* 1983
* Versatile Real-Time Executive operating system
* Reward: Volkswagen Beetle (aka Bug)


#### Companies with Bug Bounty Programs

* Mozilla
* Facebook
* Yahoo!
* Google
* Reddit
* Square
* Microsoft
