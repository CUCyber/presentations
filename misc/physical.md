## What is Physical Security?

> Physical Security is the security of systems in the physical world.


## Why do we care?

> Bad Physical Security can undermine perfect cyber security



# Basics


## Secured vs. Unsecured 

* A secured area is an area where people are assumed to have permission to be there
* An Unsecured area is an area where people can easily get to 
* Physical security is the idea of keeping these areas separate


## Threat type and level

> How loud and what kind off attack to expect

## Try it yourself



# Doors


## Hinge

> The hinge can be removed to bypass the door
> The hinge should be on the secure side of the door

## Door gap

> Allows for interacting with secured side of door


## Crash bar

> Opens door when pushed, when combined with a gap...


## Motion sensors

> Opens door when motion is sensed, when combined with a gap...



# Door badge access controls


## Idea

> A badge is required to unlock the door


## Attack vector

* replay attack of a valid card
* trick reader into sending valid unlock signal


## Badge readers

* Standard door readers require the card to be withing 3 inches
* Car based readers can read up to 3 feet



# Elevators


## Elevators

> Should not be used to secure a floor


## Bypass elevator

> bridge a wire
> independent service 
> fire service
