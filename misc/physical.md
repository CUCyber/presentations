## What is physical security?

> Physical security is the security of systems in the physical world.


## Why do we care?

> Bad physical security can undermine perfect cyber security



# Basics


## Secured vs. Unsecured 

* A secured area is an area where people are assumed to have permission to be there
* An unsecured area is an area where people can easily get to 
* Physical security is the idea of keeping these areas separate


## Threat Type and Level

> How loud and what kind of attack to expect

## Badge Readers

* Standard door readers require the card to be withing 3 inches
* Car based readers can read up to 3 feet
