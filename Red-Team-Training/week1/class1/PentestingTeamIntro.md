## Lesson 1 - Red Team Training Intro

By: Adam Van Scyoc

CU Cyber



## WTF is this "course?"


### Course Intro

* Somewhere between a seminar course and a lab
* Real-world taste of the skills that go into professional pentesting 
* Inspiration for this Course: https://www.thecybermentor.com/zero-to-hero-pentesting

note: 
* Red Team Training is somewhere between a seminar course and a lab
wherein practical pentesting and Red Team skills are introduced
and built upon.
* The idea is to give a real-world taste of the skills that go into 
professional pentesting - and, by extension, cybersecurity competitions 
such as CPTC
* CPTC = Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition

whoami: Adam Van Scyoc, Senior CpE aspects of Cybersecurity
* Contributed (a tiny bit) to Radare2
* Internship with CCIT on the Mobile Development Team
* Summer 2019 interned at Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Mass 

note: 
* transferred to Clemson in 2017 from Trident Tech, interested in Offensive "Red Team" 
* (think Argonne Nat'l Lab, Los Alamos, Sandia, etc)



## Penetration Testing Linux Distros


### Virtualization Technologies

* VMware - Desktop hypervisor for WIndows, Linux and MacOS
    * libvirt - Open Source API, daemon and mgmt tool for virtualization - KVM, Xen, VMware ESXI, QEMU
* VirtualBox - FOSS - Windows, MacOS, Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD


### Penetration Testing Linux Distros

* Why Linux?
	1. Large contributer base
	2. Ease of installation of packages
	3. Open source makes for easy and good interoperability
	4. "Free" if not Free
* Why a specialized Distro just for penetration testing?
	1. Not strictly necessary
	2. Convenient - no more or less capable than Debian or "LightArch" inately

note: 
1. re: 'Ease of installation of packages' - PowerShell has package managers, nuget and choclatey
2. Interoperability: even just the design of the Linux kernel and Linux Permissions make linux a good starting point for cybersecurity. Start out with a Linux host, targetting linux machines!
2. What do I mean by '"free" if not free?'
3. More on the "not strictly necessary" bit momentarily


### Kali vs. Black Arch

note: Potentially devisive. If you have an operating system that can run Metasploit, BurpSuite, nmap, and python, you are probably in good shape.


### Kali Linux

* Designed for Digital Forensices and Pen Testing
* Most widely used
* Debian-based (APT package manager)
* Comes with a ton of tools pre-installed and configured
* Very well supported/Stable
* Runs as root - security implications
* Installing Kali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlK174d_uu8


### BlackArch

* More packages than Kali; packages updated more frequently
* based on Arch (Nick considers this a pro in-and-of-itself)
* Pacman Package Manager
* Runs as user - possible permissions issues with things like direct hw access such as in Wireshark


### Native vs. Virtual 

* Some utilites (for example, aircrack-ng) require non-virtual hardware i.e. run natively
* VM requires less commitment - just some hard-drive space. Also very convenient - switch between Guest and Host OS'es
* VM is slower - important for things like hash cracking
* VM provides added layer of security


### Mainstream version distro - i.e. Kali Package repo's with standard Debian install

* Debian has MUCH wider contributor base, meaning much better maintenance
* Lot of custom installing and configuring - somewhat inconvenient


## How to Keep Notes Effectively


### Greenshot

MS and macOS tool for fancy screenshotting

note: TheCyberMentor from Zero-to-hero Pentesting course recommends this screenshotting
app because it allows for special features like blurring/redacting text, highlighting
portions of the screenshot, etc.
See Demo


### cherrytree

* Really cool hierarchical/tree-based note taking app.
* Supports markdown and syntax-highlighting for common programming languages
https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/


### keepnote

* Another great hierarchical note organizers
* easily organize notes, especially with templates

note:
Create standard Pen Testing Report template

## 5 Stages of Hacking


1. Denial (of Service)
2. Anger 
3. Bargaining (with Sysadmin)
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

note: This is what GOOD companies experience when they become aware of a data breach.
Bad companies dgaf.


## The Real 5 Stages of Hacking

1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Gaining Access
4. Maintaining Access (i.e. persistence)
5. Clearing Tracks

Note: 1. and 2. will be the focus of next class.
1. Recon: Open Source Intelligence and Social Engineering; passive actions only - no direct attacks. Job Titles, Names, contact info. General info about organization/website
2. Still not attacking per se, but loud enough that can (theoretically) be detected. Enumreate open ports, crawl entire webpages, use vulnerability scanners - broadspectrum or specific, like metasploit. Intrusion Detection Systems are very aware of these methods.
3. Gaining Access - taking advanage of vulnerabilites by executing exploits. Priveledge escalation. Relies on misconfifuration or security oversights by the target's administrators.
4. Maintaining Access - plant malware - malicious code - that can act as a backdoor, allowing future access to the attacker. Sometimes these come in the form of rootkits, back doors or RATS - Remote Administration Tools. Often hackers will exploit some vulnerability, install something that allows them to maintain access, then patch the vulnerability so other hackers can't get in.
5. Clearing Tracks - deleting log files, command histories, malicious users or programs added by attacker. Using digital forensics to thwart response teams attempting to perform Attribution.
