## Web Apps


### What is a Web App?

* Program where a client runs it in the browser
* Webmail (Gmail), Amazon, Ebay, Wikipedia, etc.
* Difference between dynamic websites and web apps is vague


### How do you communicate with one?


### HTTP!


### Hypertext Transfer Protocol

* Request-response protocol in the client-server computing model
* Application Layer (7) - OSI Model


#### Example

* Web Browser (Chrome) is the Client
* Apache is the Server
* Chrome submits an HTTP request message to the server hosting `google.com`

![http](http.png)


#### Example

* Server returns a response message to the client
* Response contains status information (200 OK), requested content in body

### HTTP Request

`Method` `SP` `Request-URI` `SP` `HTTP-Version` `CRLF`

* `SP` = Space " "
* `CRLF` = Carriage Return & Line Feed "\r\n"


#### Methods

* GET - Retrieve info from server using URI
* HEAD - GET, status and header ONLY
* POST - Send data to server

Note:
* PUT - Replaces all the current representations of the target

Note:
There are also these four methods, but they're hardly used
* DELETE - Removes all the current representations of the target
* CONNECT - Establishes a tunnel to the server at URI
* OPTIONS - Describe the communication options
* TRACE - Performs a message loop back test to the target


#### Methods Refined

* GET - Get data from the server
* POST - Push data to the server

#### GET

`GET http://www.Google.com HTTP/1.1`

![http](http.png)


#### GET Request

```HTTP
GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.google.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

Note:
Following the typical HTTP Request format is a bunch of Request Header Fields. This allows the client to pass additional information about the request or the client itself to the server.


#### POST Request

```HTTP
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: length
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

## Burpsuite


### What is Burpsuite?

* A graphical tool for testing Web Application Security
* Written in Java
* Developed by PortSwigger Security
* [https://portswigger.net/burp](https://portswigger.net/burp)


### What can it do?

* HTTP Proxy - MITM your browser
* Scanner - Web App Vuln Scanner
* Intruder - Automated Web App Attacks (SQLi, XSS)
* Spider - Crawls Web Apps
* Repeater - Modify requests, resend, observe
* Decoder - Decode data (Base64, URL, etc.)
* And more!


### How does any of this help me?


#### HTTP Proxy

* Modify GET/POST requests through a MITM attack


##### POST Request

```HTTP
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: length
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

username=nick&password=mysupercoolpassword
```


##### POST Request

```HTTP
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: length
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

username=admin&password=mysupercoolpassword
```


#### Spider

* Find hidden resources on a website
