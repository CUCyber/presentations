# SQL Injection


## What is SQL Injection

* SQL Injection is running arbitrary SQL on a database due to a flaw in implementation.

Note:
* This can be the way the data base receives queries
* Or how the string is sanitized


## Where can you find it?

* SQL Injection can be found on sites using login forms
* Search bars.
* Anything where the user puts in input and the server returns something


## Why is it useful?

* SQL Injection is useful for a multitude of reasons, but most people think of getting passwords.
* SQL Injection can be used for: 
    * Information gathering
    * Getting a foot hold on the server
    * Getting a Shell
    * etc.

Note:
* By foothold I mean internal network access to computers that would other wise not be accessible
* Those types of computers a typically more vulnerable to attack due to some companies not having defense in depth


## Why its hard

* SQL Injection is hard to do by hand due to the vast number of possibilities that exist in database configurations.
* A tool that would automate some of the most common configurations would be great.
    * Enter SQL Map

Note:
* Simple SQL Injections



# What is SQL Map


## Another tool for the toolbox

* SQL Map is an automated tool that will allow you to preform complicated SQL Injections
* Useful for when you think something may be SQL Injectable based on prior information gathering


## HTTP Request Types

* GET
    * Requests data from a specific source
    * Passes it as values in the URI
```http
        /form/test_form.php?username=&password=
```

* POST
    * Posts data to a specific source
    * Passes it as values in the header
```http
POST /test/demo_form.asp HTTP/1.1
    Host: inserthosthere.com
    username=value1&password=value2
```

Note:
* SQL Map handles these differently and you must determine what method the web server is using
* The parameters is what SQL Injections target because that is what is passing information to the database


## Digging SQL Map options

    * -u : Host you are targeting
    * -a : Will grab everything back that it can, Highly intrusive
    * -b : Will just prove that the site is injectable, Low intrusion
    * --passwords : will enumerate the DB for password hashes and users
    * --tables : Will find table names
    * --columns : Will enumerate columns in a table
    * -D : what database to enumerate
    * -C : What columns to pull down


## Using Firefox to your advantage

* Developer options can show network traffic between you an your host
* You can use this to craft your own requests or pull information back from a website


## Using SQL Map

* DEMO using DVWA
