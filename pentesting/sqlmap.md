# SQL Injection

Where does this fit into penetration testing?

Note:
* Web vulnerability, so this type of attack should be a consideration when threat modeling


## What Is SQL Injection?

* SQL injection is a command injection technique used on web servers to run arbitrary SQL commands on a database

Note:
* This can be the way the database receives queries or how the string is sanitized


## Where Can You Find It?

* SQL injection vulnerabilities can be found on sites using
    - Login forms
    - Search bars
    - Anything where the user puts in input and the server returns something from a database

## Why Is It Useful?

* SQL injection is useful for a multitude of reasons, but most people use it for getting passwords
* SQL injection can be used for
    - Information gathering
    - Getting a foot hold on the server
    - Getting a Shell
    - Etc.

Note:
* By foothold I mean internal network access to computers that would other wise not be accessible
* Those types of computers are typically more vulnerable to attack due to some companies not having in depth defense


## Why It's Hard

* SQL injection is hard to do by hand due to the vast number of possibilities that exist in database configurations
* A tool that would automate some of the most common configurations would be great
    - Enter SQL Map

Note:
* Simple SQL injections



# What is SQL Map


## Another Tool for the Toolbox

* SQL Map is an automated tool that will allow you to preform complicated SQL injections
* Useful for when you think something may be SQL injectable based on prior information gathering


## HTTP Request Types

* GET
    - Requests data from a specific source
    - Passes parameters as values in the URI

```http
GET /form/test_form.php?username=admin&password=password HTTP/1.1
Host: inserthosthere.com

```

* POST
    - Posts data to a specific source
    - Passes it as values in the body

```http
POST /test/demo_form.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: inserthosthere.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 31

username=value1&password=value2
```

Note:
* SQL Map handles these differently and you must determine what method the web server is using
* The parameters are what SQL injections target because that is what information is passed to the database


## Digging Into SQL Map Options

* `-u` - Host you are targeting
* `-a` - Tell SQL Map to grab everything back that it can, highly intrusive
* `-b` - Tell SQL Map to just prove that the site is injectable, low intrusion
* `--passwords` - Tell SQL Map to enumerate the database for password hashes and users
* `--tables` - Tell SQL Map to find table names
* `--columns` - Tell SQL Map to enumerate columns in a table
* `-D` - Database to enumerate
* `-C` - Columns to retrieve


## Using Firefox to Your Advantage

* Developer options can show network traffic between you an your host
* You can use this to craft your own requests or pull information back from a website


## Using SQL Map

* Demo using DVWA
