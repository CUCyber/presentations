# SQL Injection

Where does this fit into penetration testing?

Note:
* Web vulnerability, so this type of attack should be a consideration when threat modeling


## What Is SQL Injection?

* SQL injection is a command injection technique used on web servers to run arbitrary SQL commands on a database

Note:
* This can be the way the database receives queries or how the string is sanitized


## Where Can You Find It?

* SQL injection vulnerabilities can be found on sites using
    - Login forms
    - Search bars
    - Anything where the user puts in input and the server returns something from a database

## Why Is It Useful?

* SQL injection is useful for a multitude of reasons, but most people use it for getting passwords
* SQL injection can be used for
    - Information gathering
    - Getting a foot hold on the server
    - Getting a Shell
    - Etc.

Note:
* By foothold I mean internal network access to computers that would other wise not be accessible
* Those types of computers are typically more vulnerable to attack due to some companies not having in depth defense



# SQL Commands


## User Table

|Id|Username|Password|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|admin|admin|
|2|user|test|
|3|hack|me|


## SELECT

* `SELECT * FROM users;`

|Id|Username|Password|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|admin|admin|
|2|user|test|
|3|hack|me|


## SELECT

* `SELECT Id FROM users;`

|Id|
|:-:|
|1|
|2|
|3|


## SELECT

* `SELECT Username, Password FROM users;`

|Username|Password|
|:-:|:-:|
|admin|admin|
|user|test|
|hack|me|


## SELECT

* `SELECT Password FROM users WHERE Username = 'admin';`

|Password|
|:-:|
|admin|


## UNION

* Combine two or more select statements
* `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 UNION SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;`

Note:
How can this be used during a SQL injection?
