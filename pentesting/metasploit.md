## What is Metasploit?

Note:
Metasploit is a penetration testing platform that enables you to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities.


## Setting Up MSF


### Database

* Metasploit uses a PostgreSQL Database to manage work flows and information
* This database can hold recovered usernames, passwords, sessions, etc.


#### Kali Linux

* Setting up the database is much easier in Kali Linux
* First you must start the postgres service

```bash
service postgresql start
```

* You must then create the database so Metasploit can utilize it

```bash
msfdb init
```


### Initializing the Database

* Before PostgreSQL can work correctly you must initialize a database
* Switch your user to the 'postgres' user using either

```bash
# prefered method
sudo -i -u postgres
# alternate method
su postgres
```

* Then initialize the database after you have become the postgres user

```bash
initdb --locale $LANG -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'
```

* Now you can enable the PostgreSQL server with no errors

Note:
* `--locale` pulls information from /etc/locale.conf
* `-E` is the default encoding of the DB
* `-D` is default location where the cluster is stored
    - If default location is changed you must update the service file
    - If root is under home then make sure you turn off the `ProtectHome` option


### Creating the msf database

* We need to create a user that Metasploit will connect to the database with

```metasploit
createuser <username> --interactive
```

* Now we need to create a database, 'msf', Metasploit will be able to use

```metasploit
createdb msf -u <username>
```

Note:
* When creating the user answer 'n'/'y'/'y'
* When creating the database, name it 'msf' so that its easy to work with in Metasploit



## Setting Up Metasploit


### Connect Metasploit to the DB

* Now we need to tell Metasploit
    - What user to connect to the database with
    - What database to connect to

```metasploit
db_connect <username>@msf

# you can alias msfconsole in your .bashrc to run it everytime
# quiet disables ascii art
alias msfconsole="msfconsole --quiet -x \"db_connect <username>@msf\""
```

* After which you will need to build the database cache; this might take a few minutes

```metasploit
db_rebuild_cache
```

Note:
* You will have to run this every time you connect to your `msfconsole`
* Check the `db_status`



## Metasploit Info


### Module types

* Everything in Metasploit is a module
* 6 types of modules
    - auxiliary
    - exploit
    - payload
    - post
    - encoder
    - nop


#### Auxiliary

* Modules that are good for information gathering
* Port scanning
* Version detection
* Network traffic analysis


### Exploits

* Weaponized code that targets a vulnerability on a system
* Only works on systems that match the specific exploit criteria


### Payloads

* A payload is what Metasploit uses to execute specific actions on a remote system post-exploitation
 - Open a remote shell
 - Meterpreter session
* Comes in 3 main forms:
 - Inline (Non Staged)
 - Stagers
 - Stages

Note:
* Singles are payloads that are self-contained and completely standalone. A Single payload can be something as simple as adding a user to the target system or running calc.exe.
* Stagers setup a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable.
* Stages are payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules.


#### Payload Types

* Inline (Non Staged)
* Stager
* Meterpreter
* PassiveX
* NoNX

Note:
* Meterpreter resides completely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it very difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques
* PassiveX is a payload that can help in circumventing restrictive outbound firewalls. It does this by using an ActiveX control to create a hidden instance of Internet Explorer
* NoNX is designed to circumvent DEP on Windows.


#### Post

* This is typically done after a successful exploit and remote connections are set
* This is used for:
 - Collecting passwords
 - Setting up key loggers
 - Downloading files


#### Encoder

* Programs for performing encryption/character removal

Note:
* When creating an Exploit Payload, we have several things to consider, from the operating system architecture, to anti-virus, IDS, IPS, etc.
* By default Metasploit will select the best encoder to accomplish the task at hand. The encoder is responsible for removing unwanted characters (amongst other things) entered when using the -b switch.


#### NOP

* NOP generators for creating assembly code that does nothing

Note:
* In evading detection of our exploits, we will want to encode our payloads to remove any bad characters and add some randomness to the final output using NOPs.


## Searching Metasploit


### Search Filters

* Searching with the database is very fast
* Search fields
    - author
    - type
    - name
    - platform
    - bid,cve,edb,osvdb,ref


#### Author

* Module author


#### Type

* auxiliary
* exploit
* payload
* post
* encoder
* nop


#### Name

* Any phrase


#### Platform

* The type of thing you are looking at attacking
* E.g. Windows, Linux, Python, Ruby, Cisco, etc.


#### Searching Exploit Databases

* Allows you to search CVE exploit ID's



## Using Metasploit


### man use

* `use <exploit>` will load the exploit and allow you to use it

```metasploit
use <path to exploit>
```

* `info` command is like a man page for metasploit commands

```metasploit
info <path to exploit>
```


### Firing Off an Exploit!

* After you select an exploit to use, you must configure the setting to match your target

```metasploit
show options
```

* Show options will provide a list of things you need/would like to configure before the exploit can be used


#### Show options basics

* `RHOST` - Remote host, typically an IP address or a DNS name of the target
* `RHOSTS` - Same as `RHOST` but can define multiple targets
* `RPORT` - The port to attack on the remote host, this is typically configured to be the default for the service, but can be changed just in case it is not default
* `RPORTS` - Same as `RPORT` but can define multiple targets
* `Wordlist` - Allows you define a list of passwords to be used for brute forcing modules

Note:
Word lists can be found online, ROCKYOU is a good starting point.


### Payloads

* You can run exploits with out a payload
* They will do nothing for you and you will not be able to do anything to the machine
* To be able to establish a connection to the exploited machine you must provide a payload

```metasploit
# reverse TCP is an excellent payload to start with
set payload <path to payload>
```

* When you choose a payload it will add more options to your exploit
* You will want to set `LHOST` to your computers IP address

Note:
What command should be run to show the new options?
