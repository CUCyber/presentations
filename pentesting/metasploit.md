# What is Metasploit


## It's Not Latin

* The root term in Metasploit is "-sploit"
* Metasploit is primarily an exploitation framework that uses "payloads" to perform a defined set of operations to compromise a system


## Payloads

* A payload is what Metasploit uses to preform exploits
* Automated exploit on a system that matches criteria for the payload
* Payload can facilitate creating a remote shell on the system

Note:
e.g. a system that has heartbleed vulnerable OpenSSL v1 & 2


## Database

* Metasploit uses a PostgreSQL Database to manage work flows and information
* This database can hold recovered usernames, passwords, sessions, etc.



# Setting up Database


## Ubuntu Installation

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

wget -q https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

* You then need to update your package manager to recognize the new repository

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Note:
* After all this is done you will now have a user on your system called 'postgres'
* This user will have the role 'postgres' and you will be able to log in as this user to preform administration of the DB
* You may want to change this user's password using `passwd`


## Fedora Installation

* Install PostgreSQL on your system

```bash
sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
```

* On Fedora, postgres is turned off and disabled by default
* To enable it, run the command of your choice below

```bash
# To start the server at start up
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql
```

```bash
# To run the server as needed
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```


## Kali Linux

* Setting up the database is much easier in Kali Linux
* First you must start the postgres service

```bash
service postgresql start
```

* You must then create the database so Metasploit can utilize it

```bash
msfdb init
```

* Done!


## Initializing the Database

* Before PostgreSQL can work correctly you must initialize a database
* Switch your user to the 'postgres' user using either

```bash
# prefered method
sudo -i -u postgres
# alternate method
su postgres
```

* Then initialize the database after you have become the postgres user

```bash
initdb --locale $LANG -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'
```

* Now you can enable the PostgreSQL server with no errors

Note:
* `--locale` pulls information from /etc/locale.conf
* `-E` is the default encoding of the DB
* `-D` is default location where the cluster is stored
    - If default location is changed you must update the service file
    - If root is under home then make sure you turn off the `ProtectHome` option


## Creating the msf database

* We need to create a user that Metasploit will connect to the database with

```metasploit
createuser <username> --interactive
```

* Now we need to create a database, 'msf', Metasploit will be able to use

```metasploit
createdb msf -u <username>
```

Note:
* When creating the user answer 'n'/'y'/'y'
* When creating the database, name it 'msf' so that its easy to work with in Metasploit



# Setting Up Metasploit


## Connect Metasploit to the DB

* Now we need to tell Metasploit
    - What user to connect to the database with
    - What database to connect to

```metasploit
db_connect <username>@msf

# you can alias msfconsole in your .bashrc to run it everytime
# quiet disables ascii art
alias msfconsole="msfconsole --quiet -x \"db_connect <username>@msf\""
```

* After which you will need to build the database cache; this might take a few minutes

```metasploit
db_rebuild_cache
```

Note:
* You will have to run this every time you connect to your `msfconsole`
* Check the `db_status`



# Metasploit Info


## Module types

* Everything in Metasploit is a module
* 6 types of modules
    - auxiliary
    - exploit
    - payload
    - post
    - encoder
    - nop


### Auxiliary

* Modules that are good for information gathering
* Port scanning
* Version detection
* Network traffic analysis


### Exploit

* The code that will take advantage of a vulnerability
* This could be used, for example, to exploit a buffer overflow


### Payload

* This is typically done after a successful exploit
* Can be used to preform an action on the server once compromised
    - Open a remote shell
    - Meterpreter session


### Post

* This is typically done after a successful exploit and remote connections are set
* This is used for
    - Collecting passwords
    - Setting up key loggers
    - Downloading files


### Encoder

* Programs for performing encryption


### NOP

* NOP generators for creating assembly code that does nothing



# Searching Metasploit


## Search Filters

* Searching with the database is very fast
* Search fields
    - app
    - author
    - type
    - name
    - platform
    - bid,cve,edb,osvdb,ref


### App

* Client
* Server


### Author

* Module author


### Type

* auxiliary
* exploit
* payload
* post
* encoder
* nop


### Name

* Any phrase


### Platform

* The type of thing you are looking at attacking
* E.g. Windows, Linux, Python, Ruby, Cisco, etc.


### Searching Exploit Databases

* Allows you to search CVE exploit ID's



# Using Metasploit


## man use

* `use <exploit>` will load the exploit and allow you to use it

```metasploit
use <path to exploit>
```

* `info` command is like a man page for metasploit commands

```metasploit
info <path to exploit>
```


## Firing Off an Exploit!

* After you select an exploit to use, you must configure the setting to match your target

```metasploit
show options
```

* Show options will provide a list of things you need/would like to configure before the exploit can be used


### Show options basics

* `RHOST` - Remote host, typically an IP address or a DNS name of the target
* `RHOSTS` - Same as `RHOST` but can define multiple targets
* `RPORT` - The port to attack on the remote host, this is typically configured to be the default for the service, but can be changed just in case it is not default
* `RPORTS` - Same as `RPORT` but can define multiple targets
* `Wordlist` - Allows you define a list of passwords to be used for brute forcing modules

Note:
Word lists can be found online, ROCKYOU is a good starting point.


## Payloads

* You can run exploits with out a payload
* They will do nothing for you and you will not be able to do anything to the machine
* To be able to establish a connection to the exploited machine you must provide a payload

```metasploit
# reverse TCP is an excellent payload to start with
set payload <path to payload>
```

* When you choose a payload it will add more options to your exploit
* You will want to set `LHOST` to your computers IP address

Note:
What command should be run to show the new options?
