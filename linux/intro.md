# What is a "Linux"


## Short History

* Started by Linux Torvalds for lack of free kernels
* Created with a Unix-like userspace
* Monolithic architecture, i.e. batteries built-in


## So Linux is a Kernel...


* There are multiple operating systems (distributions or distros) based on Linux
* Major differences include:
    - Supported desktop environments (e.g. GNOME, KDE, Xfce)
    - Package managers that define how software is installed and updated
    - Core services (e.g. systemd, cron, avahi)
