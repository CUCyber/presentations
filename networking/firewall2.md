# Recap


## Firewalls: Stateful, Stateless


### Stateful

* Firewalls have memory to store traffic information
    - Traffic is looked at in context
    - This is called stateful packet inspection (SPI)
* Only packets of a known connection are allowed to pass the firewall
* Firewalls also implement rules on the traffic during SPI

Note:
* Can tell what stage of a TCP connection the communication is in
* Can tell if the MTU has changed
* Can tell if the packet has fragmented


### Stateless

* Do not store traffic information
* Each packet is treated as a new connection
* Based on rules
    - These are sometimes referred to as access control lists (ACLs)

Note:
 * Does not know if a packet is pretending to be something you requested


## Zones


### Why Zones

* Different requirements for different parts of the network
* Businesses are typically too large for simple rule based policies
* More granular control over traffic flow


## Rules 


### Basics

* Source: where the traffic came from
* Destination: where the traffic is going
* Service: the service that the traffic is for
* Interface: interface the traffic is expected from
* Direction: going in or coming out
* Action: allow, deny, drop, reject

Note:
* Source: You can specify computers that traffic is allowed to come from.
* Destination: You can specify where traffic is going.
* Service: You can specify what service is allowed to connect to this.
* Interface: You only want traffic that is coming in on Ethernet.
* Direction: You can only SSH out of the network no incoming connections are allowed.
* Action: You can drop or allow connections matching the above rules.



# Routing


## Subnets

* A subnet is a sequence of IP addresses aligned to a bitmask
* Basically a range of IP addresses that start on a power of two and are as long as a power of two
	- An example is starting on 10.0.0.0 and ending on 10.0.0.15


### CIDR Notation

* Subnets are noted in CIDR notation:
	- `<base address>/<bitmask>`
	- Example: 10.0.0.0/28 (10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.15)
* Base address is the starting address
* Bitmask is a number identifying the free binary digits in the address
* Basically do 2^(32 - bitmask) to get the number of addresses in the subnet


## Interfaces

* Physical or virtual port on the firewall
* Segregates parts of the network and requires rules between them
* Has an address and a subnet
	- Usually combined into one format: `<address>/<bitmask>`
	- Example: 10.0.0.3/28


## Metrics

* Distance between routes
* Used to prioritize a valid route over another


## Gateway

* Endpoint to a higher network (e.g. the internet)
* Usually a catch-all route (0.0.0.0/0)
* Usually has the highest metric

Note:
It has the highest metric so that it is not chosen for internal packets


## Routing Tables

* Each item in the table is chosen in order of lowest metric first
* A packet matches if that packet's destination matches the route's subnet (e.g. 10.0.0.0/28)
* A packet goes out on the interface for the route that gets picked
* The first route that matches gets picked


### Example

```
10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0 metric 0
10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 metric 0
0.0.0.0/0 dev eth3 metric 10
```



# Network Address Translation (NAT)


## Source Translation

* Changes the source address of a packet
* Can make a packet from 10.0.0.3 appear as though it is coming from 10.0.0.5
* Simple rewrite after routing


## Destination Translation

* Changes the destination address of a packet
* Can make a packet going to 10.0.0.3 instead go to 10.0.0.5
* Simple rewrite before routing


## NAPT

* Network Address and Port Translation
* A type of translation where multiple addresses are multiplexed behind a single address
* Can make a packet from 10.0.0.4 go to 130.127.255.250 and back without 130.127.255.250 knowing the actual source address


* Does source translation so that source address is that of the router
* Adds routes based on addresses and ports of connection to allow those packets to get back to the original host



# Zones


## Typical Zones


### Internal

* Internal network usually are more dynamic than external networks
* Typically require dynamic routing

Note:
* What would you put in the internal network?
    - databases
    - another firewall
    - things that do not need to be public


### External

* Typically have static routing
* More stringent rule policies

Note:
* Why would rules be more strict in the external zone?


### Guest 

* Rules configure for computers that are guests on the network


### DMZ

* Does not have a way into the internal network
* Has the most strict rules (typically no traffic can leave unless specifically allowed)

Note:
* What are things you would put in a DMZ?
    - DNS
    - static websites
    - etc.


## Separation

TODO



# Virtual LAN (VLAN)


## Tagging

* Packets in a virtual LAN are tagged at layer 2 between the hosts
* Allows supportive hardware to use this extra information to route and rule packets
* Security relies on trusting the lines which are tagged


## Configuring

* Generally configured in the switch and firewall
* Hosts can configure VLANs too, for example if they are hosting VMs
* Assign tags to interfaces (physical or virtual) and add routing and rules between them in the switch or firewall



# Rules


## Why Rules?

Rules are the fundamental access control mechanism in a firewall. They decide what happens to the traffic.


## Examples


```
TODO
```



# Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)


## DPI

* In DPI routers look at the whole packet instead of just the relevant layer 3 header
* Many commercial firewall solutions, e.g. Palo Alto, have this feature


## Monitoring

* Use in monitoring to understand trends between what the packets are doing
* Examples are getting fields from HTTP headers or reporting versions used in TLS handshakes


## Intrusion Detection (IDS)

* Use in intrusion detection by either detecting signatures or anomalies
* Packet capture or metadata kept can be used later for manually finding an intrusion


## Malware Detection

* Use in malware detection via known malware signatures or methods of delivery


## App-ID

* Use in creating rules based on the detected application
* E.g. allow actual MySQL data on a port instead of TLS data



# Virtual Private Network (VPN)


## Site-To-Site

* Connects two disjoint networks via a gateway
* Usually configured in the routers allowing it to send packets between the networks transparently
* Layer 2 or layer 3


## Remote Access

* Connecting to a remote network and accessing the hosts
* Layer 2 or layer 3
