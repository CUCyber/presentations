CU Cyber Presentations
======================

In this repository are the markdown sources to presentations given by CU Cyber.

## Building

To build all of the presentations into a hostable directory, edit the 'makefile' as desired and run 'make'. All of the necessary files that should be put on a web server will be created in the 'public' directory.
